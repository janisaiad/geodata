\section*{Conclusion}

We presented in this article the Sinkhorn divergences for unbalanced optimal transport. 
%
We provided a theoretical analysis of both these divergences and the associated Sinkhorn's algorithm in the setting of continuous measures with compact support.
%
This shows how key properties from the balanced setting carry over to the unbalanced case. 
This however requires some non-trivial adaptations of both the definition of the divergences and the proof technics, in order to cope with a wide range of entropy functions.
%
The resulting unbalanced Sinkhorn divergences offer a versatile tool hybridizing OT and MMD distances which can readily be used in many applications in imaging sciences and machine learning.
